# DAC_Application
Personal learning project building a Web Application for a DAC (dispensery appliance contractor) company.

I had a previous role in a call centre for a medium sized DAC in the north west after leaving my role as a Data Analyst, being a small company I had the intention
of moving into an Analyst role. 
Upon starting the job role I discovered the system was outdated, the company used Microsoft 'Great Plains' which I had never heard of, the software was reminiscent
of late 90's VBA programs. The GUI was cumbersome but after a few hours I became comfortable. I slowly discovered the database to be very slow, this would regularly
slow down throughout the day. The finance team would run reports late afternoon slowing all operations on the database to a crawl. One particular issue that I 
found irksome was the loading and saving of notes on patients accounts.

After a few months I showed initiative in the role and was moved to an important contract dealing with 'Spina Bifida' patients in co-operation with a charity.
For a reason unknown to myself this particular account had even slower database operations when processing patient notes, this would make it very difficult to work 
at the required speed expected by the employer, causing me a great deal of frustration. I spoke to my manager about this and we contacted the IT contractors for a solution. Sadly the contractors did not reply.

Over time I sat at my desk frustrated with what was a simple system that performed so poorly that I decided to investigate how I could design a new system plus 
after my previous role doing Data Analysis I wanted to try a new field in IT. 

After designing a basic database, I had applied for a new job as the current role was too exhausting and made personal skill development difficult in the evenings
and weekends. Due to the pandemic the new job role fell through after I left the DAC job role. So I decided to spend some time re-learning my lost Web Development
skills and implementing a simple DAC Application was the ideal project. I had always prefered compiled languages such as Java and C over Python. 
After research I found Go to be interesting for its simplicity, speed and stability. So I decided to develop the application backend in Go.

And here we are...
